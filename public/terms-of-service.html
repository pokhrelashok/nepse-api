        <li>Your portfolio data is stored in your Google Drive within the app’s folder; we do not store it elsewhere.</li>
        <li>We only request the limited Google Drive permissions needed to create and manage the files we generate for you. We do not access other files in your Drive.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>5. Availability and Changes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We aim for reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.</li>

      <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date and provide notice within the app when changes are material. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
